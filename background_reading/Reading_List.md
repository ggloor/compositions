#There are a number of books or guides on compositional data analysis. The vast majority of these discuss CoDa from a gelolgical point of view:

##The basics:

Aitchison, J. The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data (1986)

Aitchison, J. A Concise Guide to Compositional Data Analysis. http://ima.udg.edu/Activitats/CoDaWork05/A\_concise\_guide\_to\_compositional\_data\_analysis.pdf

Pawlowsky-Glahn, Vera and Egozcue, Juan José and Tolosana-Delgado, Raimon. Modeling and Analysis of Compositional Data (2015)

##Functional guides:

Van den Boogaart, K Gerald and Tolosana-Delgado, Raimon. Analyzing compositional data with R (2013)

Aitchison, John and Greenacre, Michael. Biplots of compositional data (2002). Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series C, 51:375
